# DNP_DataAnalysis
Data analysis project for a DNP graduate nursing student that collected real world data from an HIV clinic about an issue she thought could be addressed. The nursing professors came to the CS department looking for professors with students who were willing to analyze their students data. The project consists of 30 patients at an HIV clinic who have a history of not showing for their appointments, they took steps to intervene by alerting the patients 3 times, 3 different ways before their next appointment, and they collected the data to see if the intervention was effective.
